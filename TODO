<!-- Does it worth using optimized FSS? Does the proof holds? -->

<!-- Use ic with one key-Gen but two invocations -->

<!-- Put those unit tests within new constructed class/structures -->

<!-- Why it doesn't show zero but all 2*beta? Due to an internal error -->

<!-- Erros made that not differentiating input bits length and output length -->

Simulate network delay, how?

Does cw reducing save quite a lot communication volume? Not that much, packing is quite costing, should be optimized.!!

Is it because the seed expanding algorithm the bottleneck for python fss evaluation? Needs to verify.

Fix the FSS_KEY_LENGTH problem

<!-- for c1 computation k0,k1 length:
v2Bin len is:  629
v3Bin len is:  629 -->

<!-- for c2 computation k0,k1 length:
bin len is:  752
v3Bin len is:  629 -->
